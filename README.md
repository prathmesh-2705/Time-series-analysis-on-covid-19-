Time Series Analysis
ðŸ”¹ What is Time Series Analysis?
â€¢	A technique to analyze data points collected over time (e.g., COVID-19 cases).
â€¢	Helps in understanding seasonality, trends, and forecasting future values.
ðŸ”¹ Techniques Used
âœ” Trend Decomposition â€“ Using seasonal_decompose() to break data into Trend, Seasonality, and Residuals.
âœ” Moving Average â€“ Smooths fluctuations by computing 7-day rolling averages (rolling(window=7).mean()).
âœ” ARIMA Forecasting â€“ Used to predict future cases using past trends.

Forecasting with ARIMA Model
ðŸ”¹ What is ARIMA?
â€¢	AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) is a statistical model for time series forecasting.
â€¢	It predicts future values based on past trends.
ðŸ”¹ ARIMA Steps in Code
1.	Split data into train (80%) and test (20%).
2.	Train the ARIMA model using ARIMA(train, order=(5,1,0)).
3.	Make Predictions on the test set using .forecast().
4.	Plot actual vs. predicted values to evaluate accuracy.

ðŸ“Œ Conclusion
This project analyzes COVID-19 trends, detects patterns, and forecasts future cases using data visualization, decomposition, and ARIMA modeling. These techniques help understand the impact of COVID-19 and make informed decisions.
