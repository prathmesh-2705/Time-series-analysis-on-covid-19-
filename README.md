Data Collection & Preprocessing
ðŸ”¹ What is Data Collection?
â€¢	The process of gathering raw data from sources like APIs, CSV files, or online databases.
â€¢	In this project, we load a COVID-19 dataset using pandas.read_csv().
ðŸ”¹ Preprocessing Steps
â€¢	Convert date columns into datetime format (parse_dates=['date']).
â€¢	Handle missing values using dropna() or fillna().
â€¢	Rename columns if necessary for consistency.

Data Visualization
ðŸ”¹ What is Data Visualization?
â€¢	Helps in understanding patterns and trends in data.
â€¢	We use Matplotlib and Seaborn to generate line plots for cases over time.
ðŸ”¹ Techniques Used
âœ” Line Graphs â€“ To show the rise and fall of COVID-19 cases.
âœ” Grid & Formatting â€“ Used for better readability (plt.grid(True)).
âœ” Date Formatting â€“ To improve x-axis labels (plt.xticks(rotation=45)).
âœ” Removing Scientific Notation â€“ mticker.FuncFormatter(lambda x, _: f"{int(x):,}") ensures proper formatting.

Time Series Analysis
ðŸ”¹ What is Time Series Analysis?
â€¢	A technique to analyze data points collected over time (e.g., COVID-19 cases).
â€¢	Helps in understanding seasonality, trends, and forecasting future values.
ðŸ”¹ Techniques Used
âœ” Trend Decomposition â€“ Using seasonal_decompose() to break data into Trend, Seasonality, and Residuals.
âœ” Moving Average â€“ Smooths fluctuations by computing 7-day rolling averages (rolling(window=7).mean()).
âœ” ARIMA Forecasting â€“ Used to predict future cases using past trends.

Forecasting with ARIMA Model
ðŸ”¹ What is ARIMA?
â€¢	AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) is a statistical model for time series forecasting.
â€¢	It predicts future values based on past trends.
ðŸ”¹ ARIMA Steps in Code
1.	Split data into train (80%) and test (20%).
2.	Train the ARIMA model using ARIMA(train, order=(5,1,0)).
3.	Make Predictions on the test set using .forecast().
4.	Plot actual vs. predicted values to evaluate accuracy.

ðŸ“Œ Conclusion
This project analyzes COVID-19 trends, detects patterns, and forecasts future cases using data visualization, decomposition, and ARIMA modeling. These techniques help understand the impact of COVID-19 and make informed decisions.
